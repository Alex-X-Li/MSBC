Mini scintillating bubble chamber related codes

Julia_MC.ipynb: the electron propagation in LAr with alternative electric field. The code is written in Julia 1.0.5

MC_jnote.ipynb: the electron propagation in LAr with constant electric field in python 3.6.

MC_plot.ipynb: the plot for the output data from Julia_MC.ipynb, which also include the semi ellips bubble approximation and probability of electron inside bubble.

fiducial volume.py: determined the fiducial volume of the bubble chamber with given error tolerence.

argon_bubble.py: the bubble radius ODEint base on the Kozynets paper and the inital condition is given by the MD simulation.
